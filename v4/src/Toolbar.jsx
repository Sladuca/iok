// Plan?
// Graph -> container component that links graph modifying
// state + actions -> redux
// IokEdit -> presentational component for showing both toolbar and cytoscape graph

// Sidebar -> container component for the sidebar
// IokText -> presentational component for the sidebar

// App -> Main app that has the whole iok

// Navbar -> we don't really have a navbar anymore?
// Landing -> what even is this
// AddNodeModal/EditNodeModal -> keeping until we figure out how to do this
// ListIoksModal -> same thing
